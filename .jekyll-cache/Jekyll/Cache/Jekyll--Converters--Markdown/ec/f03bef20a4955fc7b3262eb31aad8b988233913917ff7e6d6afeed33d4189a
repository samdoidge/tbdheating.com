I"¢<p>Weâ€™ve built an amazing team to solve all heating solutions, covering both gas and oil systems. Our chief engineer, Tom (Benjamin Doidge), who the company is named after, initially studied Computer Science at Imperial College London, before deciding he wanted to be more hands-on. He brings his great technical aptitude to be able to solve problems quickly and make the installation of complex systems simple.</p>
